Usage details Coming Soon.

## Installation

* [Install Homebrew](http://brew.sh/), the OSX package manager.
* Run these commands in your Terminal app to install omnislice:

        brew update
        brew tap philc/omnislice
        brew install omnislice --HEAD

    This will install the omnislice utility into /usr/local/bin, and install an AppleScript launcher for
    omnislice into ~/Library/Scripts/Applications/Omnigraffle 6.

* Download and move FastScripts into your Applications folder. This allows you to run Applescripts using
  Keyboard shortcuts.
* Make FastScripts run on system startup.

## Future work

* Render a progress bar when exporting.
* Expose any errors clearly.
